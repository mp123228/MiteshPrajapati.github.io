						  one bright june morning three years ago i was reading my kannada newspaper as usual it was the day the sslc results had been published while 
columns of roll numbers filled the inside pages the list of rank holders with there photographs tool up almost the entire front page</p>

           <p> i have a great fascination for rank holders rank is not merely an index of one's intelligence it also indicates the hard work and perseverance that 
students have put in to reach their goal my background i was brought up in a professor's family and my own experience as a teacher have led me to 
believe this</p>

         <p>of all the photographs in that morning's newspaper one boy's photo caught my attention i could not take my eyes off him he was frail and pale but there
was an endearinf sparkle in his eyes i wanted to know more about him i read that his name wass hanumanthappa and that he had secured the 8th rank that 
was all the information i could gather</p>

         <p>the next day to my surprise his photograph was published again this time with an interview with growing interest i learned that he was a coolie's son
he was unable to study further he said in the interview because he lived in a village and his father earned only Rs 40 a day hanumanthappa was the oldest
of five children his father was the only breadwinner they belonged to a tribal group </p>

       <p>i felt sorry for this bright boy most of as send our children to tuitions to coaching classes buy them reference books and guides and provide the best 
possible facilities for them without considering the cost but it was different for  hanumanthappa of rampura he had excelled in spite of being denied some
of the basic necessities of life while i was thinking about him with the newspaper still in my hands i gazed at a mango tree in my neighbour's compound
it looked its best with its fresh bark tender green leaves glistening with dewdrops and mangoes that were about to ripen in a few days beyond the tree was
a small potted plant which i noticed had remained almost the same ever since it was potted</p>

       <p>it was a calm morning the air was cool and fresh my thoughts were running free the continuous whistle of our pressure cooker broke the silence reminding
me that half an hour had passed</p>

      <p>hanumanthappa's postal address was provided in the interview without wasting much time i took a postcard and wrote a letter to him i wrote only two
lines saying that i was interested in meeting him and asking whether he could come to bangalore just then my father ever a prectical man retutned from
his morning walk he read the letter and said where will he have the money to come so far? if you want him to come here send some money for his bus fare
plus a little extra to buy himself a decent set of clothes </p>        

     <p>so i added a third line to say that i would pay for his travel and clothes within four days i received a similar postcard in reply two senrences in the first
he thanked me for the letter in the second he expressed his willingness to come to bangalore and meet me</p>

     <p>immediately i sent him some money and details of my office address when he finally attived in our office he looked like a frightened calf that had lost
its way probably it was his first trip to bangalore he was humble he wore a clean shirt and trousers his hair was neatly parted and combed the sparkle was </p>
still there in his eyes

   i got straight to the point we are happy about your academic performance do you want to study further? we would like  to sponsor you this mean we will
pay your fees for any course of study you wish to take up wherever it may be

      he did not answer

      <p>my senior colleague who was present with me interrupted with a smile don't go at the speed of bits and bytes let the boy understand what you are 
suggesting and give us his answer at the end of the day</p>

      <p>when hanumanthappa was ready to home he said in a low and steady tone madam i want to pursue my studies at the teachers training college in 
bellary that is the one nearest to my village</p>

     <p> i agreed instantly but spoke to him a little more to find out whether there was any other course he preferred i was trying to make it clear to him that 
we would pay the fees for any course he chose the boy however seemed to know his own mind and knew exactly what he wanted

     how much money should i send you per month? does the college have a hostel facility? i asked

       he said he would get back to me after collecting the correct details

           two days later he wrote to us in his beautiful handwriting that he would require approximately Rs 300 per month he had planned to take a room
on rent and share it with his friend the two boys planned to cool for themselves in order to keep their expenses down

          i sent him Rs 1800 to civer his expenses for six months he acknowledged my draft without any delay and expressed his gratitude

          time passed one day i suddenly trmrmbered that i had to pay hanumanthappa for the next six months i sent him another draft fot Rs 1800</p>

         <p>this too was duly acknowledged but i was surprised to find some currency notes in the envelope along with his letter madam he had written it is kind
of you to have sent me money for the next six months he was not in bellary for the last two months one month our college was on holiday and during the 
next month there was a strike so i stayed at home for those two months my expenditure during these months was less than Rs 300 per month therefore i am</p>
